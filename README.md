# stacc-workshop

This repository contains two electronic structure theory tutorials for the 
2022 Summer Theoretical and Computational Chemistry (STACC) Workshop hosted by Georgia Tech. 
The tutorials are written specifically for undergraduate students who have little to no 
experience in computational chemistry and access to Georgia Tech's computing resources.

Lab 1 guides the student through:
- reading and editing Psi4 input files with annoted input files in the instructional PDF
- computing the PES of H2 dissociation with UHF, RHF, and CCSD
- submitting jobs to a cluster with .pbs scripts
- analyzing the UHF, RHF, and CCSD PES 
- drawing conclusions regarding bond breaking with UHF vs RHF

Lab 2 guides the student through:
- reading and editing Psi4 input files with annoted input files in the instructional PDF
- optimizing the geometry of water with HF, MP2, CCSD(T) and cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ
- computing vibrational frequencies of water with all methods previously indicated
- reading Psi4 input files (and using commands such as 'grep')
- nothing level of theory performance based on comparing theoretically determined bond length,
angle, and normal modes to experimental values
